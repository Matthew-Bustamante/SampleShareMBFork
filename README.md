## **What is it?**
SampleShare is a web application that uses Python's famous open-source Django web framework, MySQL for its backend database, and Docker for containerizing the project to simplify deployment and development. 
SampleShare facilitates an artistic community by enabling music enthusiasts to connect, collaborate, and share their collections of music samples. If you want to create or discover new sounds for your personal projects or showcase your developed samples, sign up with SampleShare today.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed on your respective system:
- **Git**: Required to clone the repository
- **Python 3.x**: Required to run Django and install dependencies.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the web server and database.

### Installing Git
To install Git, visit the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

### Installing Python
To install Python, visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

### Installing Docker
Follow the instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.

## **Installation**
To install the project follow these steps.

1. In your chosen directory clone the project.
```
git clone git@github.com:SampleShare/SampleShare.git
```
2. Go into the project directory. 
```
cd SampleShare
```
3. The project needs a .env file for correctly setting up the containers to run the web application and database. Run the create_env.py file to auto generate one for you.
```
python create_env.py
```
> [!caution] 
> This project is not ready for production, so the auto generated .env file should not be used when deploying the project for production as it is just a baseline to get the project installed and running. Always read the contents of any script before running them blindly.

4. In your chosen terminal/command prompt run this command inside the directory with the docker files to build and run the project.
```
docker compose up --build
```
> [!note] 
> For Windows/Mac users, make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and run it as an adminstrator before running the command. This will take some time depending on your internet speed and hardware.

## **Post-Installation**
Upon a successful run, your chosen terminal should look like this:
